  The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance
  (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for “international cooperation
  and capacity development support” in financial terms. It is essential to be
  able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the
  government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned
  with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA
  disbursements to developing countries over time.
